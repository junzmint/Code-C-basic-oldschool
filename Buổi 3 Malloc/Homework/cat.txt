I'd like to know
If there’s a more effective
Form of torture
Than knowing everyday
That you are whispering
The same sweet nothings
Into her ear as you did
Mine…''

My love for you is like the raging sea,
So powerful and deep it will forever be.
Through storm, wind, and heavy rain
It will withstand every pain.



I love you more every day,
My name I long for you to say.
Do you know just how I feel?
Do you know this love is real?
Sometimes I wonder what you think.
When you hear my name, do your cheeks turn pink?
Do you dream about me every night?
Wish to hug me and hold me tight?
Do you think we’re meant to be?
Together forever, you and me?
These are the questions that run through my mind.
Your way into my heart, you did find.
It drives me crazy as to what I should do,
Should I risk a friendship and confess to you?
Or should I keep my feelings inside,
Keep them locked up, let them hide?
I just don’t know what to do anymore,
My heart it aches, my heart it’s sore.
I love you more than you could know,
And I don’t want to ever let you go.
So even if I’m just a friend,
I’ll always love you until the end.







So I just walk out in the rain
So that the cloud could hide the pain
And baby, you will never see
The thousand tears you gave to me
And if the rain should go away
Then in my lonely room I’ll stay
So that the world will never know
How much it hurts to see you go away
