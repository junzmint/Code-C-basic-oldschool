I'd like to know
My love for you is like the raging sea,
If there's a more effective
So powerful and deep it will forever be.
Form of torture
Through storm, wind, and heavy rain
Than knowing everyday
It will withstand every pain.That you are whispering
The same sweet nothings
Into her ear as you did
Mine...'
