I'd like to know
If there's a more effective
Form of torture
Than knowing everyday
That you are whispering
The same sweet nothings
Into her ear as you did
Mine...''My love for you is like the raging sea,
So powerful and deep it will forever be.
Through storm, wind, and heavy rain
It will withstand every pain.I'd like to know
If there's a more effective
Form of torture
Than knowing everyday
That you are whispering
The same sweet nothings
Into her ear as you did
Mine...''
